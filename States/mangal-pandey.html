      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>Mangal Pandey was born on 19 July 1827 in Nagwa, a village in upper Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh. He came from a landowning high-caste Brahmin family with strong Hindu beliefs. At age 22, he joined the British East India Company's army and was made a soldier (sepoy) in the 6th Company of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry.</p>
      
      <p>The immediate cause of his revolt was the introduction of the new Enfield rifle. The cartridges for this rifle were rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat, which offended both Hindu and Muslim sepoys as it violated their religious beliefs. On March 29, 1857, at Barrackpore, Pandey attacked his British officers, seriously injuring Lieutenant Baugh. When ordered to be arrested, he turned his gun on himself but survived. He was court-martialed and hanged on April 8, 1857.</p>
      
      <p>Though his rebellion was quickly suppressed, it inspired widespread mutiny across northern India, marking the beginning of what is known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. His name became synonymous with resistance against British rule.</p>

      <h3>The 1857 Revolt</h3>
      <p>Mangal Pandey's actions on March 29, 1857, at Barrackpore marked the beginning of what would become India's First War of Independence. His protest against the new Enfield rifle cartridges (which soldiers had to bite open, potentially consuming animal fat forbidden by their religions) became the flashpoint for widespread discontent against British rule.</p>
      
      <p>The immediate consequences of Pandey's rebellion were severe. The British disbanded the 34th B.N.I. regiment, considering it untrustworthy. However, the spark he lit could not be extinguished. Within weeks, the mutiny spread to other garrisons, culminating in the full-scale rebellion that began at Meerut on May 10, 1857.</p>
      
      <p>Though the British eventually suppressed the rebellion by mid-1858, it marked a turning point in Indian history. The East India Company was dissolved, and India came under direct British Crown rule. More importantly, it sowed the seeds of nationalism that would eventually lead to India's independence in 1947.</p>

      <h3>Lessons to Learn from Mangal Pandey</h3>
      
      <div class="lesson-card">
        <h4>Courage in the Face of Oppression</h4>
        <p>Mangal Pandey demonstrated extraordinary courage by standing up against the mighty British Empire as a lone sepoy. His willingness to sacrifice his life for what he believed in teaches us the importance of standing up for our principles, even against overwhelming odds.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="lesson-card">
        <h4>Importance of Religious and Cultural Respect</h4>
        <p>The revolt began over the British disregard for Indian religious sentiments regarding animal fat. This teaches us the critical importance of respecting diverse cultural and religious beliefs in any society.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="lesson-card">
        <h4>How Individual Actions Can Inspire Mass Movements</h4>
        <p>Pandey's individual act of defiance inspired an entire nation to rise against colonial rule. This shows how one person's courage can ignite widespread change and become a symbol of resistance.</p>
