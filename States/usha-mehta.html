            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Usha Mehta was born on March 25, 1920, in Saras village near Surat in Gujarat. From a very young age, she was drawn to the Indian independence movement, participating in her first protest at just eight years old.</p>
            <p>She completed her education in Bombay (now Mumbai), earning a BA in Philosophy and later an LLB. However, her true passion lay in the freedom struggle. During the Quit India Movement in 1942, at just 22 years old, she became famous for operating the underground Congress Radio, which became a crucial tool for communication among freedom fighters when the British had banned all Congress activities and censored the press.</p>
            <p>After independence, she completed her PhD and became a professor of Political Science at the University of Bombay, where she taught for many years.</p>
